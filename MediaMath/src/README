Instruction:
    1. Price_Calculate_file.py 
        It is the program for taking an csv file as an input.
        The input csv file is named "sample_data.csv" and should be stored at the same directory as Price_Calculate_file.py.
        To run this program, type "make csv"
    2. Price_Calculate_cmd.py
        It is the program for taking an command line as an input.
        You can type various lines as input. The program will start calculating the bill once you type an extra "enter".
        To run this program, type "make command_line"
    3. Price_Update.py
        It is the program which runs continuously and takes input from command line.
        To run this program, type "make continue"
    4. The solutions are stored in the ./root directory. Do not delete it before running the program.

Explaination of algorithm:
    Take the algorithm in Price_Calculate_file.py: 
    Suppose there's n ingredients
    1. Time complexity
        1) The time complexity of processing matrix is O(n^3)
        2) The time complexity of getting root depends on the number of free variables.
          Suppose the number of free variables is m, and the average length of valid range of free varialbes (the range can be 1-40 or smaller, depends on the input value of equation) is c, then the time complexity is O(n*(c^m)).
    2. Space complexity 
        1) The space complexity of storing and processing the matrix is O(n^2). Since the program don't need extra space for copy matrix when there are free variables.
        2) The space complexity of storing the root depends on the number of valid root. If the number of root is s, then the space complexity is O(n*x).
